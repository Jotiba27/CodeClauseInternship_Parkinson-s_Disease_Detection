This project aims to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in individuals using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Early detection of Parkinson's disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze biomedical data and predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease in individuals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle . It contains various biomedical features such as voice measurements and clinical data from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
